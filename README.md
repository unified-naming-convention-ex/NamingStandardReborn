## Why?
Why not

## Supporting UNC-r
As a product owner, your support of UNC-r by following the API will result in a far smoother experience for scripters, as they are able to work on scripts that they can confidently say will work on **most** products. Once you have implemented UNC's API, you can display so by adding the badge to your website, thread or application.

You can find the badge here: ~~https://scriptunc.org/badge~~
(This badge has since been removed from our website)

This will notify people of your alliance in providing scripters with an easier method of engineering scripts that your consumers can enjoy.

NOTICE: If you, as a product owner, do not have all of these functions but yet support the ones you do - you then support UNC-r! You are more than able to display the badge on your website.

## Checking your environment

You can run the UNC-r environment checking script to see how well your executor environment supports the UNC-r standard. Find the script [here.](UNCCheckEnv.lua) The script determines what is missing, and writes the results to file under workspace.
